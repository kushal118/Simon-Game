# Simon-Game
I tried to put my Javascript and JQuery Knowledge to make Up the Simon game. The objective of the game is to repeat correctly the longest sequence of signals.

##Rules
Press any keyboard key to start. The game will briefly flash one color. Repeat the color by clicking in the button.
Then add a second color will be added. Press both cubes in the correct order to repeat the new sequence.

Each time you repeat a sequence correctly and in time, it will replay, adding one more color. Think fast, because the game speeds up as you play!

Keep playing until you don't repeat the sequence correctly or on time. You'll hear the error sound and the game will end.
